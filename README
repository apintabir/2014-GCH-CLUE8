README

coords.csv is for uploading to google maps.

RUNME is a script to build and run the solution.

adjacency_matrix.txt and coordinates.txt were given.
I combined those in clue_graph.txt so I only had to cat one file.
The '40' at the beginning specifies the number of nodes in the graph.

extra_math.cpp and extra_math.h are from http://www.geodatasource.com/developers/c

graph.cpp and graph.h have the code I wrote in them.

test_graph.txt is only the first five nodes; I used it for testing (from the physics/nanotech building to amundson should go through keller).
